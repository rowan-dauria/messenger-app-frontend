# messenger-app-frontend

**(WIP)** This is the code running the frontend of the messenger app, using socket.io for instant messaging functionality. I'm planning to integrate with the web notification API. Because I'm learning new technologies as I go, I'm most concerned with getting them working rather than implementing the most optimised design patterns at the moment.

The frontend framework is functional React, and I'm using Sass stylesheets.
